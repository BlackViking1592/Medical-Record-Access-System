# Medical Record Access System

## Overview

This project is a medical record system that helps patients and doctors store, view, and share health information safely. Patients stay in control of who can access their records, and the system ensures the data cannot be changed without permission. It is built to be easy to use, secure, and reliable for real-world medical needs.

## How It Works

1. Patients create an account and upload their medical records.
2. Records are stored safely using a mix of database and blockchain.
3. Patients choose which doctor can see each record.
4. Doctors log in and view only the records shared with them.
5. Every action is logged so patients always know what happened.
